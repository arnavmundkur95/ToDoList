# ToDoList

Small project to practice my DOM  manipulation skills using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Functionality
- Add a new todo
- Edit the text of existing todos
- Change the priority (color) of the todos
- Check a todo
- Delete a todo
- Search for todos 

Search functionality:

Searching for a todo scans each todo to find matches with the inputted string,
highlights the todo with white, and the page jumps to the first result.
